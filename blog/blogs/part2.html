<!-- White Whale Part 2: Models -->

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Hello again and welcome to Part 2 of the White whale development blog! This entry 
will discuss the models that will be used on the back end and form the base representation 
for data in our system. Every meaningful thing the user sees and interacts with is 
derived from the instances of these models, so they really are the base of the 
application that every other feature will refer to.</p>
<p>It's important to note that I didn't arrive at these models in a single pass: I created 
models that I thought would work then created instances of them in the admin panel to 
simulate real data and the interactions between the models, made some changes, and 
repeated until I arrived at the versions that 
you see <a href="https://github.com/kens-git/white_whale/commit/05b92a2e2ab7be9de30ee432a52084506f8dc64b">here</a>. 
This process of prototyping is critical because it's basically guaranteed that we've 
created multiple issues with our initial assumptions. By taking an implementation through 
its paces we can root out these issues before we're forced to deal with them at a much 
more inconvenient time (i.e., production).</p>
<p>Fortunately, this application will be in development for a while so even if the 
models aren't perfect we have the opportunity to modify them without affecting actual 
users or our sanity.</p>
<p>Before we begin:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The models are separated into different applications depending on which feature 
  they're used for, with the 'core' making up the main application that handles 
  users and other project-specific site administration features.</li>
  <li>By default, Django provides a default primary key called 'id', so we won't need to 
  manually define one in the models.</li>
  <li>I left out the __str__ methods in this post because they're not particularly 
important or relevant. They're mostly used for human-readable representations of 
models in the admin panel.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Models</h2>
<h3>Timestamps</h3>
<pre>
class Timestamps(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    modified_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
</pre>
<p>Timestamps will form the base for almost all if not all of our models. These timestamps 
will be attached to all of our data so we can see when things are created or edited. This 
will be useful in the front end for things like 'edited at' labels for comments, or 
'created at' labels for Groups.</p>
<p>The auto_now_add and auto_now parameters mean the creation and modification times 
will be automatically created and updated, respectively.</p>
<p>The Meta class with the 'abstract' attribute means we can't directly create instances 
of this model, since it doesn't make much sense to just be storing timestamps in our 
database with nothing associated with them.</p>


<h3>Profile</h3>
<pre>
class Profile(Timestamps):
    location = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True)
    statement = models.CharField(max_length=250, blank=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True)
    website = models.CharField(max_length=500, blank=True)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    profile_image = models.ForeignKey(
        'ww_albums.UploadedFile',
        related_name="%(app_label)s_%(class)s_profile_image",
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        null=True,
        blank=True)
    header_image = models.ForeignKey(
        'ww_albums.UploadedFile',
        related_name="%(app_label)s_%(class)s_header_image",
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        null=True,
        blank=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
</pre>
<p>The Profile Model is the base model for other models that represent some kind 
of 'identity', or, an entity that has a profile on the site. 
For now this just means Users and Groups, but these fields can easily be used by other 
entities later (e.g., businesses).</p>
<p>Since this is the base, it's abstract and can't be instantiated on it's own. The 
fields should mostly be self-explanatory, noting that the max_length parameters were 
chosen arbitrarily and most of the fields don't enforce any kind of formatting 
(e.g., users can type whatever they want for their phone number).</p>
<p>The on_delete for the foreign keys specify what happens 
when the object being referred to is deleted. In this case, the profile and header 
images will be set to null if the associated UploadedFile is deleted. If null, 
we'll just display a default profile and/or header image for these fields.</p>
<p>A note on the 'blank' and 'null' parameters: when something is allowed to be blank 
(blank=True), it means that users aren't required to enter a value for it when submitting 
a form. When something can be null (null=True), it means that the database is able to 
set 'NULL' as its value.</p>
<p>By default CharFields aren't nullable, with the reason being that nullable text 
creates two interpretations for empty values: null, and an empty string. The absence of 
a string (null) is not the same thing as an empty string, so this forces that 
distinction.</p>


<h3>User</h3>
<pre>
class User(AbstractUser, Profile, Timestamps):
    middle_name = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
    birthday = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    comments = GenericRelation('ww_comments.Comment')
    notifications = GenericRelation('ww_notifications.Notification')
</pre>
<p>The idea of having a User model is straightforward: obviously we need to keep track of 
who has access to our site and what data is associated with them. Through inheritance 
the base AbstractUser model provides username, password, first_name, last_name, email, 
is_staff, is_active, and date_joined fields, with the additional fields being fairly 
self-explanatory. The Profile model previously mentioned adds the rest of the fields.</p>
<p>The GenericRelations give 
us a 'reverse relationship' to all comments and notifications that a User has made, 
without having to manually query the Comment and Notification models for them.</p>

<h3>AdminNotification</h3>
<pre>
class AdminNotification(Timestamps):
    admin = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        related_name='admin',
        null=True,
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='user', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    message = models.CharField(max_length=5000)
</pre>
<p>Not much to this one: if a user does something bad enough to warrant a sternly 
written message this model provides the means to do that.</p>
<p>I don't place much priority in this for now, but in the future we will likely need 
a field that stores whatever comment, image, etc. that caused the notification 
to be sent.</p>


<h3>FeatureRequest</h3>
<pre>
class FeatureRequest(Timestamps):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True)
    comments = GenericRelation('ww_comments.Comment')
    likes = GenericRelation('ww_likes.Like')
</pre>
<p>This model tracks feature requests that users can submit, and also allows other 
users to comment on and like the request.</p>


<h3>Comment</h3>
<pre>
class Comment(Timestamps):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey()
    comment = models.CharField(max_length=5000)
</pre>
<p>Getting a little philosophical, what is a wall post? What is a reply? In abstract 
terms, they're both comments. A wall post is a comment on a profile or person, and a 
reply is a comment to a wall post or even another comment. In my design - with the 
exception of direct messages - any time a user enters a response to content on the site, 
they're creating a comment.</p>
<p>While there are certain 
<a href="https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/avoid-django-genericforeignkey/">pros and cons</a> 
of using GenericForeignKeys to model this, in this small application I feel the ease of 
use outweighs the downsides. The benefit is anything that can be commented on can be 
referenced through this model, and we don't have to have a ton of models like: 
WallPost, WallPostReply, GroupPost, GroupPostReply, and so on. The cost is that we now 
have to double-check comments to ensure that what a user is submitting can actually 
be commented on since the GenericForeignKey won't check that for us.</p>
<p>Performance <i>may</i> be an issue if the site grows a lot, but my prediction is 
that most of the data (e.g., comments, likes, etc.) can be partially or wholly kept in 
memory, meaning that a request will usually hit this in-memory cache and we won't 
need to consider database performance as much. This is only if the site starts to get 
slow but I expect it won't.</p>
<p>The fields of this model include: the user making the comment, the type of, id of, 
and the actual object that are being commented on, then finally the content of the 
comment itself.</p>
<p>I believe the (arbitrary) 5000 character limit on comments is generous, but we 
may need to revisit this limit in the future.</p>
<p>The CASCADE for the user field deletion means that if the user making the comment 
is deleted, then all of the comments they've made are also deleted. If the content 
being commented on is deleted, the comment remains in the database but the foreign key 
to that content is set to null.</p>


<h3>Like</h3>
<pre>
class Like(Timestamps):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey()
</pre>
<p>The Like model is basically identical to Comment, except it doesn't contain any data 
of its own. The existence of a Like in our database just signifies to us that something 
was liked, which is all we need.</p>
<p>Unlike Comment, if either the user who created the like or the content being 
liked is deleted, then the like is also deleted.</p>


<h3>Notification</h3>
<pre>
class Notification(Timestamps):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey()
</pre>
<p>Except for the name, the Notification model <i>is</i> identical to the Like model. 
It signifies to users that some content was posted that they may be interested in.</p>
<p>When 
the front end establishes that the user has acknowledged the notification the back end 
will delete it. Needing to sync the front and back ends for this creates potential 
for something to go wrong, so we'll see how it works out later.</p>
<p>We'll also need to consider what happens if the content is deleted after the user 
loads the page, since they may still see the notification. The options seem to be to 
sync the server and client to remove the notification from the front end, or more 
simply just show an error page that the content was removed or doesn't exist if they 
click on the link to it.</p>


<h3>Album</h3>
<pre>
class Album(Timestamps):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True)
</pre>
<p>The Album model is straightforward: a user creates a model, gives it a name, and 
optionally a description.</p>
<p>The Album on its own is basically a book cover: all 
it does it store the details of a specific album without the contents.</p>


<h3>UploadedFile</h3>
<pre>
class UploadedFile(Timestamps):
    album = models.ForeignKey(Album, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=250, blank=True)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True)
    file = models.FileField(upload_to=user_directory_path)
</pre>
<p>An UploadedFile represents, well, an uploaded file. It's associated with a 
specific Album, and optionally can be given a name and/or description.</p>
<p>The 
upload_to parameter is a function that will dynamically create the path and file 
on the server. For now this will be relative to the media folder: 
media/user{id}/album{id}/{filename}</p>
<p>Since we're allowing arbitrary files to be uploaded, we'll need to take 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/security/#user-uploaded-content-security">extra care</a> 
in ensuring we're handling them safely.</p>
<p>We'll handle multiple file uploads by using a 'multiple' attribute 
in the upload form in the front end, then looping over the files and creating 
UploadedFiles for each file in the back end.</p>


<h3>Message</h3>
<pre>
class Message(Timestamps):
    from_user = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        related_name="from_user",
        on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    to_user = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        related_name="to_user",
        on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    content = models.CharField(max_length=5000)
</pre>
<p>The Message model simply provides the means for one user to message another. Since 
messages aren't public and are sent to one specific user I don't consider them to 
be a generic 'comment' type and so have their own model.</p>
<p>The related_name parameter is to differentiate between the to_user and from_user, since 
they will both point to the same table in the database as foreign keys.</p>
<p>There is a potential housekeeping issue with this model: if both users are deleted 
then we'll have to ensure that we also delete messages that they've sent each other. 
As it stands if one side of a conversation is deleted then the other side can 
still view the message history, so when both sides are deleted there's no one 
left to look at them and they'll be removed.</p>


<h3>Group</h3>
<pre>
class Group(Profile, Timestamps):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    email = models.EmailField(blank=True)
    comments = GenericRelation(Comment)
</pre>
<p>A Group is not too different from a User model, with the exception that it's 
associated with an owner instead of a user account.</p>
<p>I've opted to preserve the group if it's deleted and will likely turn it over 
to an admin to decide what to do with it. Users, of course, can deleted their own 
groups but if a user is deleted from the site without removing their groups then 
this gives us a chance to make a judgement on what should happen to that group.</p>


<h3>GroupMember</h3>
<pre>
class GroupMember(Timestamps):
    group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</pre>
<p>This model simply tracks group membership. If either the group or user are deleted, 
then this membership is also deleted.</p>
<p>We'll also need to double-check that a user isn't trying to join a group multiple 
times.</p>


<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<p>For now I didn't add any way to track history in any of 
the models. This might be helpful for something like a history of edits on a comment 
but it complicates the initial implementation so I left it out.</p>
<p>Certain logic won't be enforced by the models but will instead be enforced when 
an instance of the model is saved or modified in the database. This includes things 
like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can't send themselves direct messages.</li>
  <li>Users can't use another user's image for their profile/header picture.</li>
  <li>Users can't like or comment on things that don't accept one of those actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The front end will imply that stuff like this isn't possible (e.g., there won't be a 
'set profile image' button for unowned images), but it will then be strictly enforced 
in the back end since it may be possible to manually create a request to the API to 
do this.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Part 3 will discuss the REST API that we will use to link the front and back ends.</p>
<p>This arguably will be just as important as the models since every interaction we 
have with the back end from our front end will be mediated by this API.</p>
