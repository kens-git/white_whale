<!-- White Whale Part 1: Introduction -->

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Welcome to the first installment in the 'White Whale' social network development blog!
 This blog documents the progress I make on the project and will include my commentary 
as I explain the decisions I make: with the goal being to provide new developers 
with exposure to a full stack web application in development. Hopefully, 
this will help bridge the gap for new developers between developing small demo projects 
and developing a reasonably production-ready project from a given specification.</p>
<p>This blog will also demonstrate how to handle new features and changes to existing 
features. I'm sure I'll get new ideas that I want to add or may even miss a detail in 
the implementation of a feature and have to modify it later.</p>
<p>The project will use Django with Python for the back end and React with TypeScript 
for the front end, though my intention is to explain my reasoning so that it will be 
applicable to any frameworks.</p>
<p>The focus for the forseeable future will be on the back end. The back end is the 
gatekeeper of the application, so it's important to get it right first before thinking 
about the front end.</p>
<p>This blog is solely focused on development, and I won't be discussing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specific development setups (IDE, plugins)</li>
  <li>Coding style</li>
  <li>Specific toolchains and other code quality tools</li>
  <li>Deployment (since there's too many possibilities)</li>
</ul>

<p>The code will be put into the following repo: 
<a href="https://github.com/kens-git/white_whale">https://github.com/kens-git/white_whale</a>. 
Note that the Docker files, scripts, and other configuration files are in a state of flux 
and are subject to change at any time, so don't rely on them. The 
app/config and app/core folders are where the code from this blog will be.</p>

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>As stated, the project is a social network with the features expected 
in a modern social network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User Profiles</li>
  <li>Media Albums</li>
  <li>Posts</li>
  <li>Comments</li>
  <li>User Feed/Recent Activity (both user-specific and site-wide)</li>
  <li>Friends</li>
  <li>Messages</li>
  <li>Chat</li>
  <li>Groups</li>
  <li>Buy/Sell</li>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Job Board</li>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>All Users Page</li>
  <li>Admin Panel</li>
  <li>Feature Request Page</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature set is pretty ambitious, so the initial MVP will only include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    User Profiles:
    <ul>
      <li>Name (first, middle, last)</li>
      <li>Location (city, state/province, country)</li>
      <li>Personal about message</li>
      <li>Status</li>
      <li>Birthday</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Website</li>
      <li>Phone Number</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Media Albums:
    <ul>
      <li>Users can upload files into albums.</li>
      <li>Albums have an associated name and description.</li>
      <li>Users can comment on uploaded files.</li>
      <li>Albums will show when they last had files added.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Posts</li>
  <li>Comments</li>
  <li>
    User Feed
    <p>The user feed displays site activity that's relevant to the user, such as comments 
on their content or replies to their posts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Recent Activity
    <p>Recent activity is the same as the user feed, but contains activity from all users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Messages</li>
  <li>
    Groups
    <p>Groups can be created for events, special interests, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    All Users Page
    <p>A basic list of all users on the site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Admin Panel
    <ul>
      <li>Admins can add new users.</li>
      <li>Admins can edit and delete content, and the offending user 
should be notified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Feature Request Page
    <p>Gives an input form where users can request features they want added.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The project will be developed with a few assumptions in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The expected number of registered users will range from a few dozen, up to a few 
thousand.</li>
  <li>The maximum number of active users will be between 20 to 100.</li>
  <li>Per the previous two points, optimizations aren't a priority.</li>
  <li>One or more users act as administrators and will control registrations. 
This means new users will only be created by an admin.</li>
  <li>Trust between users is assumed to be high, which allows the implementation to 
be simpler. For instance, there's no need to hide the content of one user from another 
via privacy settings: it's assumed every user knows the other users and willingly shares 
their content with them.</li>
  <li>While user content is available to all other users, nothing is visible 
to anyone without an account ('walled garden').</li>
</ul>
<p>While a site like this won't earn us trillion dollar valuations anytime soon, 
the simplicities these assumptions bring mean we can focus on adding features first and 
optimizing later: if we even have to at all.</p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Part 2 will introduce the models that will lay the foundation for the application.</p>
